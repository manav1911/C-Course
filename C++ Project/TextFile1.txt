What is memory management in C++?

C++ allows us to allocate the memory dynamically in run time. This is known as dynamic memory allocation.

In other programming languages such as Java and Python, the compiler automatically manages the memories allocated to variables. But this is not the case in C++.

In C++, we need to deallocate the dynamically allocated memory manually after we have no use for the variable.

We can allocate and then deallocate memory dynamically using the new and delete operators respectively.

Example:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

    // dynamically allocate memory
    int* point_int = new int{45};
    float* point_float = new float{45.45f};

    cout << *point_int << endl;
    cout << *point_float << endl;

    // deallocate the memory
    // set pointers to nullptr
    delete point_int;

    delete point_float;
    
    return 0;
}
